i.   Addition
ii.  Subtraction
iii. Multiplication
iV.  Division

2. Exponentiation:
3. Calculate the power of a number
Root Extraction:

4. Calculate the square root of a number
Trigonometric Ratios:

Calculate sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent values for a given angle in degrees

# Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Running the Program
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scientific-calculator.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd scientific-calculator
Run the program:
# Usage
Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter the type of operation you want to perform. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the necessary numbers and receive the result.

# Example operations:

1. Addition:

i.  Enter + or add when prompted for the operation.
ii.    Enter the two numbers when prompted.

2. Trigonometric Ratios:

i.  Enter trigonometric ratio or trigonometric when prompted for the operation.
ii. Enter the angle in degrees and the specific trigonometric ratio you want to calculate (e.g., sin, cos, tan).

# Code Structure
The main logic of the program is encapsulated in a series of if-elif statements that check the user's input and perform the corresponding mathematical operation. The program uses Python's built-in math module for advanced calculations.
